# WKU HRL Handbook
Website to compile information for use by RAs and Desk Assistants at WKU

## Project Overview

The WKU HRL Handbook is a centralized online resource designed to improve training and communication for Desk Assistants (DAs) and Resident Assistants (RAs) within WKU Housing and Residence Life (HRL). This project addresses the shortcomings of current training methods by providing a comprehensive, easily accessible platform for essential information, tools, and updates.

## Problem Statement

Current training and information dissemination for DAs and RAs is fragmented and inadequate. Important resources are scattered across multiple platforms (PDFs, websites, etc.), leading to confusion, inefficiencies, and a lack of awareness among staff members.

## Proposed Solution

This project aims to create a user-friendly website that serves as a single source of truth for all information relevant to DAs and RAs. The website will include:

*   **Searchable FAQ:** A comprehensive database of common questions and answers.
*   **Quick Access Links:** Direct links to essential tools like StarRez, WhenToWork, and Notifii.
*   **On-Call Information:** Dynamic display of on-call staff contact information.
*   **Training Resources:** Targeted training modules for key systems and procedures.
*   **Announcement Board:** A centralized location for important updates and policy changes from HRL management.
*   **Communication Forum:** A platform for staff members to ask questions and share information.
*   **Quick Tips:** Rotating tips to keep important information top-of-mind.

## Features

*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy navigation and information retrieval.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** Accessible on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.
*   **Role-Based Content:** Tailored information for DAs and RAs.
*   **Dynamic Content:** Real-time updates for on-call schedules and announcements.
*   **Search Functionality:** Quickly find answers to specific questions.

## Planned Features (Future Development)

*   **Onboarding Video Track:** Mandatory training videos for new hires.
*   **Gamification:** Quizzes and challenges to reinforce training concepts.
*   **AI-Powered Knowledge Base:** Integration of AI to provide faster and more personalized support.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML:** For structuring the website content.
*   **CSS:** For styling and visual presentation.
*   **JavaScript:** For interactive elements and dynamic functionality.
*   **[Potentially] PHP/MySQL:** For backend database management (if needed for advanced features).
