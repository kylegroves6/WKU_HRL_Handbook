# WKU HRL Handbook

## Project Overview

The WKU HRL Handbook is a centralized online resource designed to improve training and communication for Desk Assistants (DAs) and Resident Assistants (RAs) within WKU Housing and Residence Life (HRL). This project addresses the shortcomings of current training methods by providing a comprehensive, easily accessible platform for essential information, tools, and updates.

---

## Problem Statement

Current training and information dissemination for DAs and RAs is fragmented and inadequate. Important resources are scattered across multiple platforms (PDFs, websites, etc.), leading to confusion, inefficiencies, and a lack of awareness among staff members.

---

## Proposed Solution

This project aims to create a user-friendly website that serves as a single source of truth for all information relevant to DAs and RAs. The website includes:

- **Searchable FAQ:** A comprehensive database of common questions and answers.
- **Quick Access Links:** Direct links to essential tools like StarRez, WhenToWork, and Notifii.
- **On-Call Information:** Dynamic display of on-call staff contact information.
- **Training Resources:** Targeted training modules page for key systems and procedures.
- **Quick Tips:**  Important information to keep on top-of-mind.
