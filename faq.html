                    Yes, if they have a parent or guardian present, they can check in under their supervision. They can
                    only remain in the building as long as the guardian is present. Residents cannot check in guests
                    under 18 themselves, except under special exceptions made by WKU Housing management.

                    No longer than three days before they get charged for cohabitation. A common workaround is to
                    suggest one day on, one day off if a resident frequently checks in a significant other or partner.

                    If a resident loses their ID, report them on the "No ID Form." Advise them to either find their ID
                    or visit the ID office in Downing Student Union to get a replacement. If they don’t have their ID,
                    ask for their name, birthday, and 800 number to confirm their residency.
